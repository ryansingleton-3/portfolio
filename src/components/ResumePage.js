                            <p>I am a recent graduate of a Front End Software Engineering Bootcamp by Promineo Tech. I have just under 2 years of experience in Front End Development, including a learning platform called Codecademy, and I am pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from BYU-Idaho. I am very experienced with HTML, CSS, Python, and JavaScript. I am also familiar with React.js, Bootstrap, jQuery, AJAX, Git, GitHub, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and Responsive Web Design. 
                                Also, I have extensive knowledge in digital marketing in general, as well as SEM (Search Engine Marketing). I have multiple certifications in the industry and have worked at a digital marketing agency for 2 years. During my time at the agency, I have used my coding knowledge to speed up many processes, and improve efficiency in ad reporting by up to 20% for each employee in my department. </p>
